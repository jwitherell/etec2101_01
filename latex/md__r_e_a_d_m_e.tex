This is our simple S.\+S.\+U.\+D.\+S. (SSU Data Structures) project undertaken in ETEC2101, Spring 2025.

It contains a number of simple data structures, test programs, and other applications. In real practice, it\textquotesingle{}s probably better to use things like std\+::vector, std\+::map, etc. but hopefully this will be a good learning experience for students in this class!
