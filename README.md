# ssuds25
This is our simple S.S.U.D.S. (SSU Data Structures) project undertaken in ETEC2101, Spring 2025.

It contains a number of simple data structures, test programs, and other applications.  In real practice,
it's probably better to use things like std::vector, std::map, etc. but hopefully this will be a good learning
experience for students in this class!
